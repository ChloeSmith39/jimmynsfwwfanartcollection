    <h1 class="display-text">Hello, I came across your twitter page because we both have a similar common interest; Mouthwashing. However, I realised that you are a REPUGNANT of a fucking human being who have no selfworth and HUMANITY over real-life issues that THANKS TO YOU and other people LIKE YOU who seem to sexualise rapists. Do you know how fucking messed up that is? I bet you don't because obviously you consume it, you know it wrong but you seem to can't control your pussy, right?? Now I know to YOU and many other people from the fandom (like 90% of them) will put the excuse saying "It's just fiction", "it's just a kink", so sexualizing, romaticing rape is totally normal? are you retarted? well it fucking shows. Let me teach you some common sense (if you have any left): what YOU and part of the fandom are doing is literally normalising a REAL LIFE ISSUE that people go through, specifically woman, and by normalizing that issue you are you are downplaying its seriousness and contributing to a culture where it is dismissed or not taken as seriously as it should be. Would you like to be raped? would you like your bestfriend (if you have any) to be raped? asking seriously. Your pick me ass bitch personality should get out of the rotting bed you haven't left in years, get a job, a life whatever it is but be BETTER. You should literally use a mouthwash to clean your disgusting fucking mouth after saying those shit into the internet-- you know what? -- maybe pour it into your smooth ass brain and pussy because you truly fucking need a cleanse. If you don't take this seriously, laughing it off and brushing it off as a "hater" comment it you truly shows that you are no good of a person and no one will ever love you, not even a rapist or a psychopath will love you.</h1>
    <h5>Thank you :) and reconsider.</h5>
